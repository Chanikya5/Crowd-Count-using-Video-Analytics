# Crowd Count using Video Analytics

## Overview

This project is a smart video analytics system designed to monitor and manage crowd levels in real time. It combines computer vision, deep learning, and secure user management to deliver a full-stack solution for intelligent crowd monitoring.

With this system, users can:

  * Log in securely with authentication and session management.
  * Manage a personal user profile with additional details.
  * Upload video streams and define custom monitoring zones.
  * Track and count people in each zone using AI-based detection and tracking.
  * Visualize live crowd data through charts, heatmaps, and video overlays.
  * Receive alerts when a crowd exceeds safe thresholds.

The solution is applicable to **malls, events, stadiums, transport hubs, or public safety environments** where crowd control is critical.

## Features

#### Secure User Management & Profiles

  * **Secure Authentication:** Robust registration and login system for user access.
  * **User Profile Page:** A dedicated page for users to view their account details (username, email) and manage additional personal information like date of birth, age, place, and gender.
  * **Password Security:** Passwords are never stored in plain text and are securely hashed.
  * **Session Management:** JWT-based authentication ensures secure and scalable user sessions.

#### Zone Management

  * **Interactive Zone Creation:** Upload videos and **draw, edit, save, and manage zones** directly on the video frame.
  * **Persistent Storage:** Zone data and custom thresholds are saved in a database for each user.

#### Real-Time Analytics

  * **Live Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard with zone-wise crowd counts, updated in real time.
  * **Unique ID Tracking:** Utilizes **YOLO + DeepSORT** to assign persistent IDs to individuals, preventing double counting as they move.
  * **Data Visualization:** Includes line charts for population trends and heatmap overlays to highlight crowd density on the video feed.
  * **Smart Alerts:** The system automatically triggers alerts when the number of people in a zone exceeds the user-defined threshold.

## Project Workflow

1.  **User Onboarding** ‚Äì New users create an account through a simple registration page. Existing users can log in securely through the login page.
2.  **Profile Management** ‚Äì After logging in, users can visit their profile page to view account details and add personal information.
3.  **Video & Zone Setup** ‚Äì Users can upload a video or use a webcam feed, then draw custom zones to define monitoring areas.
4.  **Real-Time Monitoring** ‚Äì The system tracks individuals with unique IDs, counts them within each zone, and displays the data on a live dashboard.
5.  **Visualization & Alerts** ‚Äì Users can monitor trends with charts and heatmaps and receive notifications when a zone's capacity is exceeded.

## Application Walkthrough

1.  **Login and Registration**
    The application starts with a **Login Page**. New users can navigate to the **Registration Page** to create a secure account by providing a username, email, and password.
    
2.  **User Profile**
    After logging in, users can click the **"User Information"** button in the sidebar. This leads to a profile page where they can view their registration details and add or update personal information like date of birth, age, and gender.
    
3.  **Zone Manipulation Dashboard**
    The main dashboard features a "Zone Manipulation" menu with several options:
    - **Upload Video or Use Webcam:** The user can start by providing a video source.
    - **Draw Zones:** After a video is loaded, the user can draw rectangular zones over the video to define areas for monitoring.
    - **Preview & Track IDs:** Users can preview the zones they've drawn or click "Track ID" to see live tracking with unique IDs assigned to each person.
    - **Edit & Delete Zones:** Existing zones can be renamed or deleted as needed.

4.  **Live Dashboard**
    When the user clicks on the "Live Dashboard," they can view:
    - Real-time population counts for each zone.
    - Line chart visualizations showing population trends over time.
    - Heatmap overlays on the live video feed to highlight crowded areas.
    - An alert system that notifies the user when any zone exceeds its set capacity.
